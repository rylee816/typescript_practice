## testing notes from Drew
## TESTING:
 1. helps prevent unforseen bugs and side effects and makes code more extensible
 2. Creates a more proactive rather than reactive style of coding
 3. Forces you to structure your code in such a way that makes testing easier
 4. Write code where values aren't "hidden away" or inaccessable from your tests
 5. Prevents "monolithic" functions and file structures
 6. Creates a more "intentional" mindset when writing code
 7. Encourages "developer empathy" (code with other developers/users in mind)

## DOWNSIDES
 1. more time spend and more code written
 test brittleness
 2. refactoring constantly changing codebase
 3. can create a false sense of security
 4. coverage reports can lie to you
